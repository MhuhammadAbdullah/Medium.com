            <h1>Everyone has a <br>story to tell.</h1>
            <p>Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share <br>insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the <br>world - without building a mailing list or a following first. The internet is <br>noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, <br>beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right audience for <br>whatever you have to say.</p>

            <p>We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or <br>empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most <br>sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system <br>that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful <br>conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para"><mark>Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective <br>understanding of the world through the power of <br>writing.</mark></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium <br>every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many aren’t —<br> they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur novelists, <br>and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. They <br>write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, <br>what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned that the rest of us <br>might want to know too.</p>

            <p>Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing <br>community of <a href="#">Medium members</a> who align with our mission. If you’re <br>new here, <a href="#">start exploring</a>. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you. Find <br>a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider something <br>familiar—and then <a href="#">share your own story.</a></p>
